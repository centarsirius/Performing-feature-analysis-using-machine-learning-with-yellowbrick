# Performing-feature-analysis-using-machine-learning-with-yellowbrick

In this project, visualizations have been used to steer machine learning workflows. The problem tackled is to predict whether rooms in apartments are occupied or unoccupied based on passive sensor data such as temperature, humidity, light and CO2 levels. With an emphasis on visual steering of the analysis, this project demonstrated various feature analysis methods such as scatter plots, RadViz, parallel coordinates plots, feature ranking, and manifold visualization.
